# Example Sentences

1. Have you heard of that?  
**너는 그것를 듣었다요?**  
a. In Hanla, you add **-요?** at the end of a verb to make an interrogation.  
b. **그것** means *it / that* (same word in Korean).  
c. **듣다** means *to hear*. In Hanla, verbs are root + ending: 듣- + -다.  
d. **듣었다** = 듣- (*hear*) + -었다 (*past*) → *heard*.  
e. In Korean, the irregular form of heard is **들었다**, but Hanla removes irregularity.  
f. Because of this, Korean speakers can still understand 듣었다 even though it looks a bit different.
