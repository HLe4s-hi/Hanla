# Hanla Pronunciation Rules

1. **Read as written.**  
   - Each Hangul letter corresponds to exactly one sound.  

2. **Final consonant simplification.**
   - This is same rule as in Korean.
   - ㄷ, ㅅ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㅌ, ㅎ → **ㄷ**  
   - ㅋ → **ㄱ**  
   - ㅍ → **ㅂ**  
   - Examples: 꽃(flower) = [꼳], 밖(out) = [박], 잎(leaf) = [입]

3. **Linking with ㅇ + vowel.**  
   - If a final consonant is followed by a syllable beginning with ㅇ, the consonant moves to the next syllable.  
   - Examples: 같이(togather) = [가티], 먹었다(ate) = [머걷다], 책이다(is a book) = [채기다]

   **Special case: complex finals (like ㄳ, ㅄ).**  
   - Only the second consonant moves to the next syllable.  
   - Examples: 닭이다(is a chicken) = [달기다], 앉았다(sat) = [안잗다]

4. Even with these rules, some discrepancies remain between the written and spoken forms, which could make Korean speakers perceive Hanla as Korean.
