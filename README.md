# Hanla

Hanla is a constructed international language project.  
Its goal is to make a language that anyone can **learn in one hour** and immediately use for reading, writing, speaking, and understanding.

## 1. What is Hanla?
Hanla is designed as a global language with extreme simplicity as its core principle.  
The objective is to allow any learner to master the full grammar in approximately one hour, so that all sentences can be understood without ambiguity.  
Fluency and stylistic use may take practice, but basic comprehension and production are guaranteed after the initial tutorial.

## 2. Script
Hanla uses Hangul as its script.  
Hangul has been widely recognized as one of the most **scientifically designed and easy-to-learn writing systems**, with Korea’s low illiteracy rate often cited as evidence.  
Every sound maps 1:1 to its written form, with **no exceptions**.  
If you can hear it, you can write it.

## 3. Grammar
Hanla grammar follows three guiding principles:
1. **Simplicity** – A very small set of rules.
2. **Consistency** – No irregularities or exceptions are permitted.
3. **Comprehensiveness** – Within this fixed framework, all sentences must be constructible and understandable.  

The aim is that a learner can read a one-hour tutorial and then parse and produce any sentence.  
This “one-hour grammar” is the **core promise** of Hanla.

## 4. Vocabulary
Hanla uses existing Korean vocabulary.  
This choice offers three major advantages:
1. **Script compatibility** – Since Hangul is already the script, Korean words fit naturally.  
2. **Expressive power** – Korean vocabulary already covers all domains of human expression.  
3. **Practical benefit** – Learners can reuse this vocabulary when visiting Korea, making the language doubly useful.  

New words can be incorporated seamlessly by adopting existing Korean or international loanwords.

## 5. Notes
a. **Design philosophy**  
Hanla deliberately leverages Hangul and Korean vocabulary to maximize learnability and expressive power.  
Unlike minimalist languages (e.g., Toki Pona), Hanla does not sacrifice precision. There is no forced ambiguity, since full words are borrowed directly.  

b. **Learnability**  
The guarantee: anyone who reads the official one-hour tutorial (to be released) can understand all sentences under the defined rules.  
There will never be hidden exceptions or ad-hoc additions.  
Because the grammar is a simplified subset of Korean, native Korean speakers can also easily understand Hanla.  

c. **Motivation**  
Hanla functions as both a practical international language and a stepping stone toward Korean.  
Learners who study Hanla gain immediate access to Korean vocabulary and Hangul literacy.  
To Korean speakers, Hanla will sound like **unnatural Korean** of same meaning.
