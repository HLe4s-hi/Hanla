# Hanla Starter Word List

This list provides only the minimal core.  
- **nouns** you can use any nouns from Korean. It will be helpful to find '{Your language} to Korean' Dictionary.
- **Verbs** are given as stems (roots). The actual verb is created by attaching endings such as `-다` (present), `-었다` (past), `-겠다` (future).  
- **Adjectives** are used directly before nouns.  
- **Adverbs** are free-position modifiers.  
- **Pronouns** are simplified from Korean.
