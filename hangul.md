# Hangul in 30 Minutes (with Double Consonants & Compound Vowels)

Hangul(한글) = a **phonetic**, **block-based** alphabet.  
One block (syllable) = **Consonant + Vowel (+ optional final consonant)**.

---

## 0) 30-Minute Plan
- **0–5 min**: Concept & block shapes
- **5–12 min**: Consonants (plain/aspirated/tense)
- **12–18 min**: Vowels (simple → compound)
- **18–25 min**: Final consonants (받침) & quick rules
- **25–30 min**: Read real words

---

## 1) How blocks are built
- Vertical vowels (ㅏ ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅣ): vowel goes **to the right** → 가 = ㄱ+ㅏ  
- Horizontal vowels (ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ): vowel goes **below** → 고 = ㄱ+ㅗ  
- Add a final consonant (받침) **at the bottom** → 감 = ㄱ+ㅏ+ㅁ

> 한 = ㅎ(h) + ㅏ(a) + ㄴ(n)  
> 글 = ㄱ(g) + ㅡ(eu) + ㄹ(l)

## 2) Consonants (자음)

### 2.1 Plain (basic 10)
| Letter | Sound (approx.) | Note |
|---|---|---|
| ㄱ | g/k | unaspirated |
| ㄴ | n |  |
| ㄷ | d/t | unaspirated |
| ㄹ | r/l | flap r between vowels; l in final |
| ㅁ | m |  |
| ㅂ | b/p | unaspirated |
| ㅅ | s | before ㅣ-like vowels, sounds a bit like “sh” |
| ㅇ | (silent)/ng | silent at start, ng at end |
| ㅈ | j | unaspirated |
| ㅎ | h |  |

### 2.2 Aspirated (거센소리)
| Letter | Sound | Pairs with |
|---|---|---|
| ㅋ | k (strong) | ㄱ |
| ㅌ | t (strong) | ㄷ |
| ㅍ | p (strong) | ㅂ |
| ㅊ | ch (strong) | ㅈ |

### 2.3 **Double/Tense consonants (쌍자음)** — tighter, tenser, no extra puff
| Letter | Sound (tight) | Tip |
|---|---|---|
| ㄲ | kk | like strong “g/k” |
| ㄸ | tt | strong “d/t” |
| ㅃ | pp | strong “b/p” |
| ㅆ | ss | strong “s” |
| ㅉ | jj | strong “j” |

> **Rule of thumb**: Plain vs Aspirated vs Tense → 가(ga) / 카(ka) / 까(kka)

---

## 3) Vowels (모음)

### 3.1 Simple vowels (10)
| Letter | Sound | Example |
|---|---|---|
| ㅏ | a (ah) | father |
| ㅑ | ya | yard |
| ㅓ | eo (uh) | son |
| ㅕ | yeo (yuh) | young |
| ㅗ | o (oh) | go |
| ㅛ | yo | yoga |
| ㅜ | u (oo) | zoo |
| ㅠ | yu | you |
| ㅡ | eu (eu) | tight lips, central |
| ㅣ | i (ee) | see |

### 3.2 “ae/e” pair (often close in modern speech)
| Letter | Sound |
|---|---|
| ㅐ | ae (e as in “bed”) |
| ㅔ | e (eh) |
| ㅒ | yae |
| ㅖ | ye |

### 3.3 **Compound vowels (복합모음 / 이중모음)**
| Letter | Build | Common sound |
|---|---|---|
| ㅘ | ㅗ+ㅏ | wa |
| ㅙ | ㅗ+ㅐ | wae |
| ㅚ | ㅗ+ㅣ | oe/wi~we (often *we*) |
| ㅝ | ㅜ+ㅓ | wo |
| ㅞ | ㅜ+ㅔ | we |
| ㅟ | ㅜ+ㅣ | wi |
| ㅢ | ㅡ+ㅣ | ui (after consonants often “i”; particle **의** often “e”) |

> Quick feel: **w-glide** on ㅗ/ㅜ + another vowel → wa, we, wi...  
> ㅢ is the only **ui**; in everyday speech it often simplifies.

## 4) Final consonants (받침) — how they sound

### 4.1 Single final (7 “basic” final sounds)
In final position, many letters merge to these 7 sounds:

| Final written | Sound | Includes (pronounced as) |
|---|---|---|
| ㄱ | [k] | ㄱ, ㅋ, ㄲ |
| ㄴ | [n] | ㄴ |
| ㄷ | [t] | ㄷ, ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㅌ, ㅎ |
| ㄹ | [l] | ㄹ |
| ㅁ | [m] | ㅁ |
| ㅂ | [p] | ㅂ, ㅍ |
| ㅇ | [ŋ] | ㅇ |

> Ex) 밖 [박], 옷 [옫], 낮 [낟], 꽃 [꼳]

### 4.2 **Double finals (겹받침) — quick rule**
- **Usually pronounce the right-most** consonant if nothing follows:  
  ㄺ[k], ㄻ[m], ㄼ[p], ㄾ[t], ㄿ[p], ㅀ[t], ㅄ[p]
- **Exceptions (pronounce the left-side)**: **ㄳ(k), ㄵ(n), ㄶ(n), ㄽ(l)**
- **If the next syllable starts with a vowel (ᄋ)**: the **right-most** part **moves over** (liaison).  
  - 값이 → [갑시], 읽어 → [일거], 없는 → [엄는]

> Don’t over-memorize. Start with the “right-most moves” idea; learn common words.

### 4.3 A couple of easy sandhi tips (optional)
- These rules are not in Hanla, only for Korean.
- …ㅎ + ㄱ/ㄷ/ㅈ → ㅋ/ㅌ/ㅊ (좋다→[조타], 낳다→[나타])  
- ㄴ + ㄹ → [ll] (설날→[설랄]), sometimes ㅁ/ㅇ + ㄹ → [ll] too.

## 5) Read it now — from zero to words

### 5.1 Single blocks
- 가, 나, 다, 라, 마, 바, 사, 아, 자, 차, 카, 타, 파, 하  
- 까, 따, 빠, 싸, 짜 (tense taste)

### 5.2 With common vowels
- 고/구/그, 노/누/느, 보/부/브, 소/수/스  
- 겨/겨울(geyeo/gyo-ul), 뭐(mwo), 왜(wae), 위(wi), 의(ui)

### 5.3 Real words
- 한글 (han-geul) — Hangul  
- 한국 (han-guk) — Korea  
- 감사합니다 (gam-sa-ham-ni-da) — thank you (formal)  
- 맛있어요 (ma-si-sseo-yo) — tasty  
- 꽃 (kkoch) — flower  
- 읽어요 (il-geo-yo) — (I) read

---

## 6) Minimal Romanization cheat (don’t rely on it too long)
- g/k, d/t, b/p vary by position; ㅇ is **silent** at start and **ng** at end.  
- Tense (ㄲ ㄸ ㅃ ㅆ ㅉ) = **tight** versions (no puff).  
- ㅓ=**eo**, ㅡ=**eu**, ㅢ=**ui**; many compounds start with **w**: ㅘ=wa, ㅙ=wae, ㅚ≈we, ㅝ=wo, ㅞ=we, ㅟ=wi.

---

## 7) Micro-drills (2–3 minutes)
1. Build 5 blocks with ㄱ + (ㅏ/ㅗ/ㅣ/ㅜ/ㅡ) + (none/ㄴ/ㅁ).  
   > 가, 고, 기, 구, 그, 간, 감 …  
2. Read these quickly:  
   > 까-카-가 / 따-타-다 / 빠-파-바 / 싸-사 / 짜-차-자  
3. Liaison feel:  
   > 값-이, 읽-어, 없-어, 옳-아

---

## 8) Common pitfalls (so you don’t waste time)
- ㅐ vs ㅔ often sound close; context will save you.  
- ㄹ is **flap r** between vowels but **l** in final.  
- Don’t force English “sh” — ㅅ only becomes “sh-ish” before ㅣ/ㅑ/ㅕ/ㅛ/ㅠ.
