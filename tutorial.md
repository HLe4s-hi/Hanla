# Hanla Language Tutorial

## 1. Script

Hanla uses the Hangul alphabet.  
Hangul was invented in the 15th century by King Sejong of Korea and his scholars.  
It is known for being one of the most logical and easy-to-learn writing systems in the world.  
Hangul has a near-perfect one-to-one correspondence between sounds and symbols, making it extremely learner-friendly. 
There is many contents to teach hangul. for example, [extreamly short](https://youtu.be/TE4eplsFSms?si=C5mXJmyDFPbAqIUJ), and [30 minute](https://youtu.be/85qJXvyFrIc?si=DzUqZzVYO5BEocEz)

- **Reading**: Each character block represents a syllable.  
- **Writing**: Characters are constructed by combining consonants and vowels into a block.  
- **Why Hangul?**  
  - Scientifically designed and proven to be easy to learn.  
  - The low illiteracy rate in Korea is often credited to Hangul’s design.  
  - Its structure ensures no ambiguity in pronunciation.

## 2. Words

Hanla directly uses Korean vocabulary.  
This means the core lexicon is already rich, expressive, and capable of handling daily life, literature, and philosophy.  

- **Nouns**: Learners are encouraged to use Korean dictionaries or vocabulary lists. No modification is made to nouns.  
- **Other word classes**: For verbs, adverbs, adjectives, and pronouns, Hanla provides a simple standardized list derived from Korean. (A reference [wordlist](word_list.md) will be provided separately.)  
- **Expansion**: When new concepts arise, loanwords are imported directly from Korean.

## 3. Sentence Structure

Hanla grammar is deliberately simplified, while retaining familiar patterns from Korean.  

- **Particles**:  
  - Subject: `는`  
  - Object: `를`  
  - Complement (for "to be" verbs like *이다*): none. Instead, the complement immediately precedes the verb.  

- **Order**:  
  - Default: SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).  
  - Thanks to particles, variations are tolerated without loss of meaning.  

- **Verbs**:  
  Verbs are always formed from a root + ending. No irregular conjugations are allowed.  
  - Declarative present: `-다`  
  - Past: `-었다`  
  - Future: `-겠다`  
  - Progressive: `-는 중 이다` (constructed form, but standardized in Hanla).
  - more endings and roots are avaiable in word list
  - e.g. 나는 밥을 먹었다. --> I ate a meal. 

- **Adverbs**: May be placed freely within the sentence.
  
- **Adjectives**: Must appear directly before the noun they modify or before `되다`(become) or `이다`(be) verbs.

- **Complex sentences**: Clauses and phrases can be nested, allowing expressive compound sentences. (Detailed structures will be introduced later.)

## 4. negation & interrogation

- **negation**
  - add `안-` before the root of verb.
  - if there are '있' in sentence repalce them to '없'
  - e.g. 나는 밥을 먹었다. -- negation --> 나는 밥을 안먹었다.
  - e.g. 나는 지금 밥을 먹을 수 있다. -- negation --> 나는 지금 밥을 먹을 수 없다.
- **interrogation**
  - add `-요?` after the endings of verb.
  - e.g. 너는 밥을 먹었다. -- interrogation --> 너는 밥을 먹었다요?
 
## 5. Clause Linkage

- **coordination & subordination**
  - Used to connect two or more clauses. 
  - Method: place a coordinating conjunction between the clauses.  
  - Common conjunctions: *그리고 (and)*, *또는 (or)*, *그러나 (but)*. See the vocabulary list for details.  
  - Examples:  
    - 나는 밥을 먹다 **그리고** 너는 밥을 먹었다. → *I eat a meal, and you ate a meal.*  
    - 그는 공부하다 **그러나** 나는 쉬다. → *He studies, but I rest.*
    - 나는 공부하다 **그러면** 나는 똑똑한 되다. → *If I studies, I become smart.*

## 6. Clause Types

Each clause in Hanla can function as a **Noun Clause**, **Adjective Clause**, or **Adverbial Clause**, depending on its role.  
Treatment is exactly the same as for the corresponding word class.  
Clauses are formed by attaching a fixed particle after a full sentence.

- **a. Noun Clause**  
  - Formed by adding `-는 것` after a sentence.  
  - Example:  
    - 나는 도서관에 가었다는 것는 진실 이다.  
      → *That I went to the library is true.*  

- **b. Adjective Clause**  
  - Formed by adding `-는` after a sentence.  
  - Example:  
    - 나는 어제 보았다는 영화는 재밌는 이다.  
      → *The movie that I watched yesterday is interesting.*  

- **c. Adverbial Clause**  
  - Formed by adding a specific particle after a sentence (see vocabulary list).  
  - Example:  
    - 나는 밥을 먹었다**그때** 친구는 공부를 하었다.  
      → *I ate a meal, while at that time my friend studied.*

## 7. Wh-words (in progress.. inconsistency)

- **interrogatives**
  - Used to form questions by placing a wh-word at the beginning of the clause.  
  - Wh-words: *언제 (when)*, *어디 (where)*, *무엇 (what)*, *어떻게 (how)*, *얼마 (how much)* *누구 (who)* *왜 (why)*
  - Method: put the wh-word in front of the clause; word order otherwise remains the same.  
  - Examples:  
    - **언제** 너는 여기 오겠다요? → *When will you come here?*  
    - **어디** 로부터 너는 이다요? → *Where are you from?*  
    - **무엇을** 너는 하는 중이다요? → *What are you doing?*  
    - **어떻게** 너는 이다요? → *How are you?*  
    - **얼마** 그것는 이다요? → *How much is it?*  
    - **왜** 너는 안오었다요? → *Why didn't you come?*
